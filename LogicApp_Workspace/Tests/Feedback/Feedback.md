## General
In general the whole approach tries to cater for too many variations of cases, this makes it too complicated and too many things can go wrong

Id like to just generate an entire workspace with a solution file and a workspace in it, id then just like to be able to build and run it without too much faff

I think when sometimes it can have functions and sometimes it cant is just more variations and things that can go wrong

## Pipeline Generation

When I generate pipelines they are specific for 1 scenario.  In my case I had used unit tests so now I have a problem that I have to customes or create a new pipeline
before I can use them

## Pipeline for Functions Project

In my pipelines I cant see how it will build the functions project so ill have to modify the build to do that

## Pipeline Documentation

I think its important for less experienced users to have comments and links to documentation in the pipelines that are generated
